Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><span id="more"></span><p>7</p><p>Recent era has witnessed a passionate discussion regarding children’s education. While some parents lay emphasis on children’s sense of competition, others are convinced that collaboration is of greater value to kids’ development. I agree with the former point of view.</p><p>On one hand, those who attach significance to the sense of competition hold the view that it could help children adapt to society in years to come. There is no denying that in modern society, the public encounters fierce competition and stress from both their colleagues and supervisors. Consequently, provided that kids could learn to compete with others, they are more likely to face hardships bravely in the future, thus gaining an edge over others. To exemplify, when leaders assign a challenging task in the workplace, those with higher sense of competition is more able to be motivated and set a clear goal to overcome it.</p><p>On the other hand, some individuals regard cooperation as crucial in that it could equip kids with better interpersonal relationships. To be more specific, citizens currently depend on each other a great deal in terms of study and work, based on which individuals could develop closer connections, if they know how to interact with others and are more willing to collaborate with them. In this respect, it is less likely for them to suffer from loneliness in daily lives.</p><p>To recapitulate, although cooperation is capable of enabling children to develop friendships, I assert that the sense of competition plays a more important role for the reason that it could adjust them to the future stressful society.</p><h1 id="C6-Test2"><a href="#C6-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C6 Test2"></a>C6 Test2</h1><p>Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>7</p><p>Some people think that successful sports professionals’ high salaries are justified, while others think it is unfair. While it should be acknowledged that sports professionals’ success is the result of years of hardship and hard work, there are other professions that are not as well paid but should be, like doctors.</p><p>On one hand, it is understandable that successful sports professionals receive high salaries since their success is the result of incredible talent and hard work. Not a lot of people can endure the hardship needed to train for success, so those who are able to pass the test and become champions should be heavily rewarded.</p><p>However, when you think of other professions who played a vital role in the development of society and humanity and how little they are paid compared to sports stars, it doesn’t seem all that fair. Doctors, for example, are an important profession that no society could live without. In comparison, sports stars are less important as they are basically entertainment to people, while doctors’ job deals with life-or-death matters. In this light, doctors should be paid as well as, if not better than, sports professionals.</p><p>In conclusion, sports stars’ high salaries are not justified and there are other more important professions that deserve a higher income such as doctors. Although the talent and hard work of successful sports professionals should be acknowledged and rewarded, they are still part of the entertainment industry which is not a necessity to people’s life, unlike medical professionals whose job is to cure diseases and save lives.</p><h1 id="C6-Test3"><a href="#C6-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C6 Test3"></a>C6 Test3</h1><p>Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>7</p><p>Recent era has witnessed a rapid advancement of tourism and it has provoked a passionate discussion whether visitors are supposed to adopt local customs and behaviors when travelling. While some support this point of view, some argue that host countries ought to possess an open mind to this issue. I agree with the latter point of view.</p><p>On one hand, those asserting that sightseers should behave themselves as citizens in host countries do are convinced that it could avoid unnecessary disputes. To be more specific, customs and behaviors are to some extent closely connected to local individuals’ religious belief. Consequently, when travelers fail to follow local customs, chances are that their behaviors would be regarded as disrespectful or even provocative by local residents, thus leading to conflicts. To exemplify, if sightseers in middle eastern countries wear revealing clothing such as short skirts, the locals would feel discontented and quarrel with them.</p><p>On the other hand, some individuals hold the view that host countries need to accept cultural shock due to the fact that it could appeal to more tourists from other culture backgrounds and as a result, contribute to economic growth. To cite those relatively conservative nations as an instance, when the host countries are able to accept the behavior of showing affection in public, such as men and women holding hands or kissing, they are sure to attract more travelers from western countries.</p><p>To recapitulate, although accepting tourists’ distinctive behaviors may result in certain conflicts, I believe that it is advisable for host countries to be open to this for the reason that it could help them gain more prosperity.</p><h1 id="C6-Test4"><a href="#C6-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C6 Test4"></a>C6 Test4</h1><p>Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>7</p><p>Some people among us prefer change to continuity, while others consider change to be something undesirable. The latter would argue that you could only master something by focusing on it for a long period of time, but the former contends that change is what brings new possibilities, innovation and improvement. This essay discusses both of these views and decides that change is a good thing.</p><p>Doing the same things over and over is what leads to perfection. Those who master certain skills, such as world-famous pianists and cooks, get to where they are by practicing the same skill day and night for decades. If they diverge to other things during those years just to experience new and fresh things, they would not be as successful and professional as they are now. Doing the same thing over and over again indicates dedication which is a key part of success.</p><p>However, change is also desirable in situations where innovation is needed. Those who are responsible for some of the most important inventions and revolutionary changes in modern society embody the beauty and greatness of change. For example, the founders of Facebook and Taobao revolutionized the way people socialize and shop respectively, bringing immense change as well as convenience to the world while becoming one of the richest people in the world themselves. Their success are partly a result of their innovative thinking and willingness to bring about changes. Although we do need professionals who have practiced their profession for a long time and are good at what they do, the world’s progress depends on people who can bring change.</p><p>In conclusion, though doing the same things and avoiding change could perhaps lead to success, being welcome to changes and being able to bring about change are what lead to progress. Therefore, change is preferred to continuity.</p><h1 id="C7-Test1"><a href="#C7-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C7 Test1"></a>C7 Test1</h1><p>It is generally believed that some people are born with certain talents, for instance for sport or music, and others are not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or musician.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Recent era has witnessed a passionate discussion regarding the factors contributing to the success of an outstanding athlete or musician. While some are convinced that innate talents are of significance, some argue that citizens ought to attach more importance to education. I agree with the latter point of view.</p><p>On one hand, those regarding inborn virtues as crucial believe that there exist some individuals with inborn talents that can help them become would-be winners. To be more specific, it is genes that serve as the overwhelming reason for individuals’ success, and without it, there is little likelihood to become elites in certain fields. That is why an increasing number of parents make efforts to observe the innate virtues of their kids and cultivate them.</p><p>On the other hand, some citizens hold the view that every kid is able to succeed with the help of trainings due to the fact that education could equip children with adequate knowledge and proper methods in certain areas and also motivate them from time to time. As an old saying goes, genius is one percent of inspiration and 99 percent of perspiration. To exemplify, numerous world champions attribute their success to their coaches’ guide and their arduous trainings when they are interviewed after games.</p><p>To recapitulate, despite the fact that some individuals are born with certain innate talents, I assert that we should by no means be ignorant of the value of teaching in that it could endow children with basic skills as well as encouragement.</p><h1 id="C7-Test2"><a href="#C7-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C7 Test2"></a>C7 Test2</h1><p>Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>With the advancement of our society, recent era has witnessed a passionate discussion regarding punishments for crimes. While some citizens regard fixed punishments for each crime as proper, some are convinced that punishments ought to vary according to circumstances and the motivation of crimes. I agree with the latter point of view.</p><p>On one hand, those arguing that there ought to be fixed punishments hold the view that this policy could better deter citizens from committing crimes. To be more specific, provided that individuals know they would face certain punishment once they behave themselves illegally, they are more likely to give it a second thought before acting. Imprisonment as a fixed punishment is a good case in point. Likelihood of losing freedom in prisons can most effectively prevent citizens with an inclination to crime from doing harms to society.</p><p>On the other hand, other people are convinced that it would be fairer to have flexible punishments. This is because reasons for crimes may differ from case to case, and numerous crimes with the purpose of self-defense could be found in society. By no means could they be treated equally with other malicious crimes. Additionally, the authority should take the difference of various criminals into account. To exemplify, it is not humane to punish the elderly criminals in the same way with others in that they have worse health conditions.</p><p>To recapitulate, although fixed punishments could serve as deterrent, I assert that punishments are supposed to be more flexible for the reason that it would be more humanisitc.</p><h1 id="C8-Test1"><a href="#C8-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C8 Test1"></a>C8 Test1</h1><p>Some people think that parents should teach children how to be good members of society. Others, however, believe that school is the place to learn this.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Recently, the debate on whether parents or schools should teach students how to be well-behaved in society has been heated. While some people argue that it is parents’ duty, others claim that it should be learnt at school. As far as I am concerned, theories might be easier for parents to teach at home while school may provide insight into their behaviour.</p><p>To begin with, parents are the best teachers for those good traits that contribute to a good member of society. As young kids spend most of their time with parents before getting into kindergarten, they will learn a lot from their parents during the time. For example, children can learn how to be polite in their daily lives. As a result, family members are playing an important role in letting their kids know what behaviours are good.</p><p>However, schools may be a better place to see whether students are applying decent behaviour in their lives. Since some kids may not have many siblings at home, attending school seems like sending them into a small society. For example, they need to learn how to make friends and how to share in kindergarten. Therefore, these interactions with each other allow teachers to see whether a kid is misbehaving or not.</p><p>In conclusion, since family and school are two different institutions with separate roles, it seems most effective in building young people’s behaviour with family members teaching them theoretically and teachers in schools help examine whether students are following their guardians’ words.</p><h1 id="C9-Test3"><a href="#C9-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C9 Test3"></a>C9 Test3</h1><p>Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Coming technological advancement has led to a more sedimentary lifestyle for many. Numerous proposals has been made to improve public health, and one such suggestion is to increase the number of sports facilities. I believe however this is not the optimal solution and other methods, such as health advertisement would be more effective.</p><p>Firstly, building new sport facilities would increase stress on public expenditure. Modernized and technology intensive fitness facilities are not cheap to set up, and will take extensive funds to build these sport facilities. It is a significant cost, and some other solutions that might be equally effective in improving public health, such as creating healthy living advertisements and leaflets are much cheaper.</p><p>In addition, it is inevitable that many will simply refuse to go to these facilities. For many people, the problem is usually not that they cannot find a sport facility to exercise, but rather they are too busy, or lazy to go to these facilities. Since we cannot force people to go to these sport facilities, it is unlikely by creating these facilities we can attract this portion of people to exercise, hence improve overall public health.</p><p>On the other hand, these new sports facilities will be appealing to the public, since they will be brand new and will likely be able to allow more people exercising at the same time. But again, this will only be effective for people willing to exercise, but not for those less willing to exercise and hence will have little impact on overall public health.</p><p>In conclusion, I think that increasing the number of sport facilities will not be able to improve overall public health, and is more disadvantageous than advantageous. Even though increasing facilities allows more to exercise at the same time, it is costly, and does not address the populations that are less willing to exercise. Creating advertisement campaigns and leaflets for healthy eating and life style would be a cheaper, yet more effective method overall.</p><h1 id="C10-Test2"><a href="#C10-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C10 Test2"></a>C10 Test2</h1><p>Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Some people argue that students should learn what they are interested in, while others think that only useful subjects should be taught in college. As far as I am concerned, as the definition for useful is debatable, a more interest-based study should be more beneficial for students’ studies. This essay with examine both sides and elaborate on my view.</p><p>To begin with, having compulsory subjects may force students to discover their talents in science and technology. As many people consider the ability in solving tangible issues are more practical than having inspiring thoughts, they may think acquiring these skills may lead to a more promising future. For example, people who work in the IT industry may have a higher salary than writers. Therefore, these critics who value potential income than interest may want universities to narrow down the curriculum and only pass on the practical knowledge.</p><p>However, universities tend to symbolize diversity instead of competition for others. If every higher institution is providing the same programme, the labour supply will sharply increase and lead to a surplus despite its potential. Besides, by allowing students to learn what they are interested in, they can flourish in different areas other than science and technology. For instance, students may find out their talents in arts or history. In this way, providing more choice seems more advantageous for both the universities’ social contribution and graduates’ personal development.</p><p>In conclusion, since society needs both science and humanities for its development, graduates should be exposed to as many choices as there can be for their college choices. Even though limiting the variety of the courses in the university may explore students’ talent, it might be disputable for the school to decide which subjects are potentially useful as well.</p><h1 id="C11-Test3"><a href="#C11-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C11 Test3"></a>C11 Test3</h1><p>Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Recent era has witnessed an uprising trend of learning a foreign language among the general public. While some are convinced that its purpose is merely to work or travel abroad, others assert that there exist more reasons for the mentioned development. I agree with the latter point of view.</p><p>On one hand, those who regard working or travelling in other nations as the only intention of learning foreign languages hold the view that there is no point in mastering a foreign language unless individuals are actually going to use it. To be more specific, individuals are currently residing in an increasingly globalized world, where we could expect to found more transnational corporations and even find jobs in other countries. Furthermore, owing to the advancement of tourism, the mass has more opportunities to pay a visit to other countries. In this respect, the capability to speak a foreign language fluently could undoubtedly contribute to our communication with local dwellers, and nevertheless it would become a waste of time, if we rarely utilize foreign languages in daily lives.</p><p>On the other hand, some citizens emphasize that more factors could account for the trend due to the fact that mastering other languages is helpful for us to broaden horizons. Provided that citizens could speaking other languages well, they could have more access to foreign films and TV series, thus coming to know distinctive modes of thinking. In addition, the general public is able to obtain friendships with foreigners through interacting with them in platforms, such as Whatsapp, when they are capable of speaking foreign languages.</p><p>To recapitulate, although there is no denying that learning foreign languages is conducive for individuals to work or travel abroad, I believe the mass could also use them to approach the outside world.</p><h1 id="C11-Test4"><a href="#C11-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C11 Test4"></a>C11 Test4</h1><p>Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Recently, the debate on whether economic progress is the most important goal for a country has been heated. As far as I am concerned, whether a country should proritise its economic growth over other developments depends on its developing states. In this essay, I will outline both sides and elaborate on my view.</p><p>To begin with, economic expansion is one of the most effective instruments in poverty reduction. For example, for developing countries like Cambodia, development in economy exposes its citizens to more job opportunities which result in a rapid growth in its finance. In this way, the progress in their economy may lead to an increase in people’s quality of life. Meanwhile, if a large population of the country are under poverty, the enhancement in education or environment may not be effective as people may not even be able to survive under high level of poverty. Therefore, economic progress seems more crucial for developing countries as it may help curb poverty.</p><p>On the other hand, other developments like educational process may be more advantageous for developed countries to sharpen their competitive edges in the long run. As providing more educational resources to the public can enhance a country’s soft power. For countries like the UK, providing mandatory schooling policy that covers all of its school-aged children allows it to have more efficient labour force and become more productive in the future. Therefore, educational progress may be another crucial factor for a country’s development which tend to be equivalent to economic progress.</p><p>In conclusion, whether economic progress should be the most important goal for governments depends on the developing environment of the country. Prioritising economic expansion can help developing countries to narrow down the poverty gap efficiently while other developments like education seem more favourable for developed countries in the long term.</p><h1 id="C12-Test1"><a href="#C12-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C12 Test1"></a>C12 Test1</h1><p>Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research,business and the academic world.Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.</p><p>Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Some people think that it is agreeable to share information as much as possible in fields like scientific research, business and the academic world, while others contend that some information should not be shared freely due to their special importance and value. This essay would argue that although some information should be preserved as they might lead to chaos or danger once they fall in the wrong hands, it is for the betterment and advancement of knowledge and society that information should be shared as freely as possible.</p><p>The contention that information in the world of scientific research, business and academics should not be shared freely is understandable because some advanced knowledge in these fields could be misused if people with bad intentions get hold of them. Knowledge like the methods to make deadly weapons and produce narcotics, for example, should be withheld from the public to prevent horrible situations from happening, like bio-hazardous weapons being made by terrorists or illegal drugs being produced and traded by drug dealers. It is highly important to limit the access to such knowledge lest people like anarchists and terrorists would use them against mankind.</p><p>However, there are plenty of knowledge in scientific research, business and the academic world that should be spread and learned by more people to push forward the development in these fields. For instance, more cost-effective ways of production could be shared in the business world to reduce the waste of human resource, time, energy and materials. Fordist ideologies and the Scientific Method are still being learned by business students till this day, and they can move on to contribute to the society and their country by practicing knowledge shared by their predecessors. It is for the general development of society that valuable knowledge should be shared freely.</p><p>In conclusion, information in the scientific research, business and the academic world should be shared as much and as freely as possible, except the ones that are hazardous in nature and which upon sharing, might lead to accidents or catastrophes that threaten the peace and safety of the public.</p><h1 id="C12-Test3"><a href="#C12-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C12 Test3"></a>C12 Test3</h1><p>In a number of countries, some people think it is necessary to spend large sums of money on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities. Others believe the money should be spent on improving existing public transport.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Some people think that investing in new railway lines for high-speed trains should be a priority of the government, while others think that the money should be spent on improving the country’s existing public transport. On the one hand, high-speed trains would benefit a country’s economic development and therefore should be invested upon, but that does not mean improving the current transportation should be neglected because public transport like buses are also important in citizen’s daily life.</p><p>The construction of high-speed trains is necessary because it would benefit the country’s economic development. Goods and people can be transported across the country more efficiently, saving money and time for both enterprises and individuals. For instance, China which have developed a sophisticated system of railway lines across the country makes Chinese citizens’ life a lot more convenient. People can travel from one city to another in a lot less time, which promotes tourism and also allow those who work in the city travel back home more easily. The development of China’s railways benefited both its citizens and the society’s development. Therefore, the construction of new railway lines would be a very worthwhile investment to a country.</p><p>However, other public transport like buses and metro are also important to citizen’s daily life and should also be improved, but improving these transportation methods shall not cost as much as the inter-city trains. On one hand, improving the bus and metro service could make people’s life more convenient. With better local public transport, people can go to work in a cheaper, greener, and also time-efficient way. However, these services do not cost as much as the construction of a new and better railway system across the country. Therefore, the majority of the government’s budget should go to the development of a railway system while the improvement of other transportation should be considered a second priority.</p><p>In conclusion, both new railway lines and existing public transport are important to a country and its citizens, but as the former would cost a lot more than the latter, the government should put more money into the investment of the former.</p><h1 id="C12-Test4"><a href="#C12-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C12 Test4"></a>C12 Test4</h1><p>Some people believe that allowing children to make their own choices on everyday matters (such as food, clothes and entertainment) is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes. Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Some people claim that autonomy may lead to egoist, however, others argue that it is crucial for one’s growth. As far as I am concerned, children should have their own decisions with guidance teaching the desirable value. This essay will examine both sides and elaborate on my view.</p><p>To begin with, making their own decisions is necessary for kids to be responsible. Through making choices, youngsters will know that they need to bear the consequence of their own decision. For example, if a child prefers not to have lunch, the kid needs to suffer from hunger after. As it is inevitable to have undesirable outcomes, children are forced to be more conscious of their choices. Consequently, instead of being abounded with egoists, society should be filled with people who are more considerable for themselves as well as the community.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is also crucial for the parents to guide their offspring when they are learning to pick their own choices. Since the cognitive development of the younger generation is immature, children might need their parents to teach them what is favourable and what is not. For instance, if a kid always makes decisions irrespective of others’ wellbeing, they might become egocentric if their parents do not take any action to interrupt it. Therefore, these spoiled youngsters may become selfish in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, young people should be provided with some free wishes under their parents’ guidance. Since family is not the only factor that affects one’s characteristics, kids may also learn how to care about each other when they are in school before getting into society. As a result, the concern that autonomy may lead to a selfish individual may not prevail in humanity.</p><h1 id="C13-Test3"><a href="#C13-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C13 Test3"></a>C13 Test3</h1><p>Some people say History is one of the most important school subjects. Other people think that, in today’s world, subjects like Science and Technology are more important than History.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>In contemporary society, the significance of distinctive academic subjects has provoked a passionate discussion. Some are convinced that history is still of great value, while in others’ eyes, a wide range of novel subjects are more important. I agree with the latter point of view.</p><p>On one hand, those attaching great significance to history assert that history is a crucial part of a country’s culture. To be more specific, history is the record of a country’s vital events and achievements, which could showcase the invaluable wisdom and knowledge of our ancestors. In this respect, learning about history could not only equip us with a profound understanding of our country, but also enable us to gain a sense of belonging.</p><p>On the other hand, a number of citizens regard subjects like science and technology as important due to the fact that compared with history, these subjects could add to our employment competitiveness. In modern age, with the rapid development of technology, individuals’ lives are closely connected to science, such as artificial intelligence. The occupation programmer is a good case in point. Provided that students spend longer time learning subjects, such as mathematics and coding, it would be easier for them to find jobs in the future.</p><p>To recapitulate, both sides possess their reasonable arguments. Although history is able to let students be well-informed about their countries, I hold the view that learning subjects like science and technology is more crucial for the reason that in modern context, these subjects could provide them with better job opportunities.</p><h1 id="C14-Test1"><a href="#C14-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C14 Test1"></a>C14 Test1</h1><p>Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money. Others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations.</p><p>Disccuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>There is no denying that citizens would encounter a number of barriers in daily life. Some are convinced that accepting the situation is a proper choice, while in others’ eyes, individuals are supposed to make efforts to tackle it. I agree with the latter point of view.</p><p>On one hand, those who are inclined to keep the status quo assert that it is their destiny to suffer from these difficulties, which dedication could not make a difference to. To exemplify, people from African countries are likely to believe the imbalanced economic development and adverse geographical conditions are to blame for their poverty. As a consequent, they find their personal efforts useless and tend to accept this disadvantageous situation.</p><p>On the other hand, some tend to confront difficulties for the reason that they are able to develop a wide range of abilities in the process. To be more specific, when individuals try to address dilemmas, it is not only possible for them to obtain problem-solving competency, but also citizens could gain an optimistic mindset and strong willpower, which is conducive to them in the long run. Starting up businesses is a good case in point. In the situation of joblessness, trying to improve the status quo through it could help individuals to develop leadership and innovation.</p><p>To recapitulate, both sides assert their reasonable arguments. From my point of view, although some problems are hard to reverse, it is not advisable for the general public to surrender to them. Instead, fighting with detrimental situations could showcase our backbone and persistence and is also beneficial for us to obtain various capabilities.</p><h1 id="C14-Test2"><a href="#C14-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C14 Test2"></a>C14 Test2</h1><p>Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Others say that there are more important environmental problems.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Some people contend that the major environmental issue in today’s world is the extinction of particular animals and plants, while others think that there are more important environmental issues. It is understandable to consider the lives of animals and plants an important issue, but I think that there are bigger and more imminent issues that we should think about, like the problem of climate change which can be life-threatening for animals and humans alike.</p><p>The loss of certain species of animals and plants is important because it threatens the planet’s biodiversity. When a certain location’s biodiversity is compromised as certain animals and plants go extinct, the ecosystem of that location is damaged and may lead to further catastrophes.</p><p>However, other environmental issues such as climate change are more life-threatening than a less biodiverse environment. Climate change brings extreme weather like floods and hurricanes that could directly lead to the loss of property and human life. A number of islands that do not live high enough above the sea level are predicted to be wiped out by the ever-increasing sea level that is the result of global warming. Hence, climate change is a phenomenon that has more direct adverse impacts on human beings.</p><p>In conclusion, people may consider the loss of some species of animals and plants and important environmental problem because it does harm to our planet’s biodiversity and the ecosystem inhabited by certain animals, but this issue is far less important than that of climate change, as the latter directly threatens the survival of human habitats and humans.</p><h1 id="C15-Test3"><a href="#C15-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C15 Test3"></a>C15 Test3</h1><p>Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it.<br>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>6.5</p><p>Recently, the debate on whether advertisements will be influencing has been heated. While some people argue that it can persuade us to purchase, others claimed that it is too common to be noticed in our daily life. As far as I am concerned, the effectiveness of commercials should be judged by their impacts on their target audiences. This essay will discuss both sides and elaborate on my view.</p><p>To begin with, advertisements may increase the credibility of the brand. As the rise in diverse brands may create struggles and confusion for consumers, targeting endorsements may intrigue their audience to buy something as the trial. For example, cosmetic brands use advertising to cajole their target audiences to purchase their products by highlighting the effectiveness of the product and their advantage compared to their substitutes. Once customers are satisfied with their first consumption, they may be easier to be persuaded by the advertisements from the same brand.</p><p>However, being bombarded by numerous advertisements may also create mental fatigue in watching them, especially for those audiences who are not targeted by the advertisement. For instance, students in universities may not be interested in child caring products. Since many brands are conducting mass advertising that whoever use that certain social platform can see, the advertisement may be less convincing for those who already lacked interest in that area. In this way, people may immune the amount of the advertisement and stop paying attention to it in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, since each brand has its own target audience, the strength in persuading the audience to purchase may be more outstanding for their target audiences in comparison with the general public. Nevertheless, since big data is collecting every user’s preference and providing direct advertisements, the effectiveness of advertisements in the future may be more favourable.</p><h1 id="C17-Test3"><a href="#C17-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C17 Test3"></a>C17 Test3</h1><p>Some people believe that professionals, such as doctors and engineers, should be required to work in the country where they did their training. Others believe they should be free to work in another country if they wish.</p><p>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p>7</p><p>Recent era has witnessed an uprising trend of globalization and it has provoked a passionate discussion whether professionals ought to remain where they received training. While some agree with this opinion, in others’ eyes, it is advisable for them to have the freedom to decide where they want to work. I am in accordance with the latter point of view.</p><p>On the one hand, those who are inclined to keep the status quo argue that professionals have gained familiarity with local residents and lifestyle. Cultures vary from country to country, which leads to the fact that specialists need to spend time getting accustomed, provided that they modify their country of working. To be more specific, professionals who did training in China do not need to waste time getting used to Chinese lifestyle in that they have mastered Chinese and developed social network there, which could help them save a large amount of time.</p><p>On the other hand, some are convinced that specialists should be free to work where they want for the reason that income levels are not equal around the world. To exemplify, programmers in the US are generally paid more than in Russia. In this respect, professionals are capable of earning more money, if they choose to work abroad. Moreover, specialists may encounter a better chance of self-development when they are free to work overseas. There is no denying that developed countries possess a higher level of technology and research, thus enabling professionals to enrich expertise in their professionalism if they are allowed to work in another nation.</p><p>To recapitulate, both sides assert reasonable arguments. As far as I am concerned, although working in the place of training can help specialists stay in their comfort zone, being free to choose workplaces can let professionals lead a better life and gain expertise.</p></div><div class="article-licensing box"><div class="licensing-title"><p>Task 2 讨论观点</p><p><a href="https://zoctan.github.io/2022/10/30/zh/english/ielts/writing/task_2/discuss_both_views/">https://zoctan.github.io/2022/10/30/zh/english/ielts/writing/task_2/discuss_both_views/</a></p></div><div class="licensing-meta level is-mobile"><div class="level-left"><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Author</h6><p>Zoctan</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Posted on</h6><p>2022-10-30</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Updated on</h6><p>2022-11-20</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Licensed under</h6><p><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Creative Commons" href="https://creativecommons.org/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons"></i></a><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Attribution 4.0 International" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons-by"></i></a><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Noncommercial" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons-nc"></i></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="addthis_inline_share_toolbox"></div><script src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-634fc88092b0a58a" defer></script></article></div><div class="card"><div class="card-content"><h3 class="menu-label has-text-centered">Like this article?
