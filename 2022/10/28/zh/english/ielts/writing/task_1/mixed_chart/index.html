It is also noticeable that France was the most popular tourist target country for UK residents.</p><p>In terms of the line graph, similar figures could be found for visitors to and from the UK, namely around 10 million in the year of 1979. In the following 20 years, the volume of sightseers coming from the UK increased significantly more rapidly than its counterpart. In 1999, approximately 54 million Britain citizens choosing to travel abroad, whereas merely 28 million travelers paid a visit there.</p><p>When it comes to the bar graph, France was regarded as the most popular among UK citizens, with its figure being 11 million, followed by Spain, to which 9 million British traveled in 1999. By contrast, merely respectively 3, 2.5 and 2 million of Britain sightsees visiting USA, Greece and Turkey.</p><h1 id="C4-Test2"><a href="#C4-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C4 Test2"></a>C4 Test2</h1><p>The graph below shows the demand for electricity in England during typical days in winter and summer.

It is also noticeable that the British household overwhelmingly utilizes electricity for heating water and rooms.</p><p>In terms of the line graph, the electricity demand in winter drops from around 40,000 unites at 3 o’clock to the bottom (30,000 unites) at 8 o’clock before it climbs to the peak at approximately 45,000 unites 14 hours later. By contrast, the electricity demand in summer is significantly lower with the highest rate at 20,000 unites at 14 o’clock, whereas in summer, individuals need the least electricity at 9 o’clock, which is merely 12 ,000 unites.</p><p>When it comes to the pie chart, heating rooms and water is the main source of electricity usage for the English home, representing 52.5%, followed by ovens, kettles and washing machines that occupy 17.5%. Furthermore, the same figure, namely 15%, could be found for lighting, TV, radio and vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electric tool.</p><h1 id="C6-Test1"><a href="#C6-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C6 Test1"></a>C6 Test1</h1><p>The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The infographics provided illustrate global water usage in different areas, as well as detailed water consumption data for Brazil and Congo.</p><p>Overall, global water usage has increased immensely over the years, agriculture remains the leading water usage sector, and the more advanced a country is, the more water it uses.</p><p>Looking at the global water use by sector graph it is evident that global water usage by 2000 has increased almost nine-folds since 1900. The largest sector of water usage was and is still Agriculture. At 1900, agriculture water usage was around 500 km3, but in year 2000 this number has increased to over 3000Km3. Industrial water usage and domestic usage has also increased immensely, from almost no usage at 1900 to 1000 km3 and around 400 km3 at 2000 respectively.</p><p>The table provides some detailed statistics for Brazil and Congo. According to the data, Brazil has a population of 176 million people while Congo only 5.2 million. However, Brazil’s average water consumption per person is 359 m3 at year 2000, which is 40 times more than the number for Congo residents, suggesting a positive correlation between state development and citizen water consumption.</p><h1 id="C8-Test1"><a href="#C8-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C8 Test1"></a>C8 Test1</h1><p>The pie chart below shows the main reasons why agricultural land becomes less productive. The table shows how these causes affected three regions of the world during the 1990s.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The pie chart illustrates the major reasons for land degradation globally and the table shows how significance these factors were during the 1900s.</p><p>Overall, overgrazing is the most obvious cause for land degradation and Europe is the most severely affected area.</p><p>For the causes of worldwide land degradation, there were three main factors that contributed to around 30 percent of the cause respectively. Globally, 35 percent of the degradation was caused by over-gazing and 30 percent was resulted by deforestation. A further 28% was caused by over-cultivation of crops, and other factors only contributed to 7 percent in total.</p><p>For the extent of damage, Europe was the worst affected area. Over 23% of its land was degraded where 9.8 percent was because of deforestation, 7.7 percent was due to over-cultivation and 5.5 percent was contributed by over-grazing. However, while over-gazing played a small role in European land degraded, it was the major cause for the land degradation in Oceania which contributed to 11.3 percent of the total land degraded. Besides, Oceania was not affected by over-cultivation and deforestation only resulted in 1.7 percent of its land degradation. Lastly, North America was the least affected region where the total land degraded was only 5 percent, where 3.3 percent was due to over-cultivation, 1.5 percent was due to over-grazing and the last 0.2 percent was due to deforestation.</p><h1 id="C11-Test4"><a href="#C11-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C11 Test4"></a>C11 Test4</h1><p>The table below show the number of visitors to Ashdown Museum during the year before and the year afterit was refurbished.

Overall, the refurbishment brings a positive result on both the total amount of visitors and the ratio of satisfaction.</p><p>To begin with, the table shows a significant increase in the number of annual visitors after the refurbishment. The number of the annual visitors was 74,000 before the refurbishment and it jumped up to 92,000 in the year after the refurbishment.</p><p>For the chart, there were 40 percent of the visitors who were not satisfied with the museum before the refurbishment. Besides, 10 percent of the tourists were very dissatisfiied with the museum. Only 30 percent of the visitors were satisfied, which doubled the ratio of those who were very satisfied.</p><p>Meanwhile, the chart illustrates an outstanding increase in the ratio of visitors who were very satisfied in the year after refurbishment. A 20-percent increase can be found in the ratio of visitors who are very satisfied while another 40 percent of the visitors were satisfied with the museum. Though there were also 5 percent of visitors who did not response, the ratio of visitors who were very dissatisfied dropped from 10 percent to 5 percent after the refurbishment.</p><h1 id="C14-Test2"><a href="#C14-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C14 Test2"></a>C14 Test2</h1><p>The chart below shows the value of one country’s exports in various categories during 2015 and 2016.

Textiles is the category that made the least money. The general layout of values continued in 2016. From the table, it can be noted that all categories have seen a rise in earnings in 2016 except gems and jewelry which fell by 5.18%.</p><p>Both the export earnings for petroleum products and engineered goods saw a small increase in the given period, with both categories reaching $60 billion in 2016. Despite its lowest export value, earnings in textiles went up in 2016, exceeding $30 billion, and was the category that saw the biggest percentage increase, by 15.24%. In contrast, the change in agricultural products was minimal, rising only 0.81% according to the table.</p><p>Gem and jewelry continued to be the middle one among all five categories in 2016, and its value even decreased by around 5%.</p><h1 id="C15-Test4"><a href="#C15-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C15 Test4"></a>C15 Test4</h1><p>The chart below shows what Anthropology graduates from one university did after finishing their undergraduate degree course.

Only 5% of these undergraduates engaged in part-time work plus postgraduate studies, which were the smallest percentage among the six categories.

Then local taxes’ contribution ranked the second and the least came from other sources. In both years, the money was mainly spent on salaries and the least percentage of the budget was spent on technology.</p><p>In both years, the majority of the budget came from National Government. Up to 175.5 million came from National Government in 2017 and in 2018 the number rose to 177.8 million. Local taxes contributed 91.2 million to the budget in 2017 and 102.3 million in 2018.
