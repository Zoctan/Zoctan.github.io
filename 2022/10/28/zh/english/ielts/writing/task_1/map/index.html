A new supermarket (S) is planned for the town. The map shows two possible sites for the supermarket.</p><span id="more"></span><p>7</p><p>The map sheds light on two proposed locations (S1 and S2) for a new supermarket in the town of Garlsdon, whose population reaches 65,000.</p><p>Overall, it can be seen that S2 is situated in the town center, while S1 is in the countryside. It is also noticeable that S1 is adjacent to the town of Hindon but S2 is near the town of Bransdon and Cransdon.</p><p>In terns of S1, it is located in the northwestern rural area of Garlsdon, which consumers from Hindon and Garlsdon can easily have access to. Furthermore, it is close to the railway and thus shoppers from Cransdon, a town with a population of 29,000 can reach it with ease but it is relatively hard for citizens in Bransdon to get there.</p><p>When it comes to S2, it lies in the town center surrounded by housing and industrial areas, making it convenient for dwellers there to go shopping. Moreover, although it is not accessible by the main road, the railway is available, which enables shoppers from Hindon and Cransdon to do some shopping there.</p><h1 id="C9-Test1"><a href="#C9-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C9 Test1"></a>C9 Test1</h1><p>The two maps below show an island, before and after the construction of some tourist facilities.</p><p>7</p><p>The given maps illustrate the changes an island underwent after the construction of various tourist facilities.</p><p>Overall, the island has been transformed into a tourist resort with all sorts of facilities and accommodation. Before, it was very empty and there was nothing on the islands except some trees.<br>15 cottages for accommodation have been built in the west and the middle parts of the island. Between the cottages there is a restaurant and a reception place. There is a vehicle track that connects the restaurant, the reception and the pier to the south of the island, and the track also goes around the reception. Footpaths connect all of the cottages with each other. The sea area just beyond the beach is now open for swimming. Some boats are parked around the pier. The east side of the island is still underdeveloped and empty as it was before, with nothing but trees.</p><h1 id="C12-Test2"><a href="#C12-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C12 Test2"></a>C12 Test2</h1><p>The maps below show the centre of a small town called Islip as it is now, and plans for its development.</p><p>7</p><p>The maps show the development plans for Islip town center. There will be quite a few noticeable changes, including the road in the town center, decrease in park size, more facilities built and more housing areas being developed.</p><p>As of now, the Islip town center can be accessed via a main road that runs across it horizontally. Miscellaneous shops are situated on either side of the main road. The housing area and the local school are located to the south of the main road and the shops, and can only be accessed via a road branching south as of now. At the south eastern part of the town center, there is a park, connected by another branched off road from the main road.</p><p>In the development plans, there will be quite a few noticeable changes to these current facilities. The most substantial would be the overhaul of the main road to the town center: It will be extended into a dual carriageway, encircling the entire town center and the road segment remaining inside the town center will be used exclusively by pedestrians. The northern row of the shops will be extended and repurposed, into a bus station, a shopping center and a car park. The park previously situated in the south east will notably shrink, and the housing areas located in the southern part of the town center will be expanded, with new housing built by the park, as well as in the north east part of the town center. Overall, the new town center will be able to provide more service and is more accessible.</p><h1 id="C13-Test1"><a href="#C13-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C13 Test1"></a>C13 Test1</h1><p>The two maps below show road access to a city hospital in 2007 and in 2010.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The two maps given display the road access to a city hospital in 2007 and in 2010 respectively.<br>Overall, the layout of the roads that surround the city hospital are roughly the same in 2007 and 2010. The major changes around the city hospital in 2010 are the changes in the car parks and bus stations. Also there are two new roundabouts constructed within the surrounding roads.</p><p>In 2007, the city hospital was surrounded by a ring road which connected to the Hospital Road to the south side of the hospital. Hospital Road continued to meet City Road in a crossroad down south, and there was a car park for both staff and public to the east side of Hospital Road. Also, Hospital Road had six bus stops on its sides in 2007.</p><p>The main roads around the city hospital remain unchanged in 2010, but there are some new constructions and changes in car parks and bus stations. First, the original car park is now open to staff only, and there is a new public car park built on the east side of the city hospital. Two roundabouts have been added to two ends of Hospital Road, one is connected to the Ring Road that surrounds the hospital and the other one is connected to City Road. The bus stops on the sides of Hospital Road have been removed and there is a bus station on the west side of Hospital Road in 2010.</p><h1 id="C13-Test4"><a href="#C13-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C13 Test4"></a>C13 Test4</h1><p>The plans below show the layout of a university’s sports centre now, and how it will look after redevelopment.</p><p>7</p><p>The maps compare the current plan of a university’s sports center with its proposed layout after revamp.</p><p>Overall, it can be seen that this sports center will be extended westward and eastward after the redevelopment. It is also noticeable that more facilities will be made with the purpose of satisfying users’ needs.</p><p>To start with, the entrance is proposed to be extended after the revamp, with a new sports shop and a café separately situated in west and east side. Facilities in the center, including the 25m pool, seating and changing room will remain unchanged during the redevelopment, apart from the gym which would be extended to the east.</p><p>Further, great modifications will be found in the place of the present outdoor courts. A new changing room plus a large leisure pool will replace the current west court. In terms of the east court, two dance studios, a sports hall and an extra changing room are planed to be constructed there.</p><h1 id="C14-Test4"><a href="#C14-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C14 Test4"></a>C14 Test4</h1><p>The plans below show a public park when it first opened in 1920 and the same park today.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The plans given display the maps of the same public park when it first opened in the year of 1920 and now.</p><p>Overall, the parks have undergone some considerable changes. A majority of its features in 1920 have been removed and turned into something else. A small number of facilities remain till this day, and there are also some additional functions.</p><p>The major facilities in the park have been changed. First, the fountain in the center of the park has been turned into a rose garden with seats around it. The stage for musicians was upgraded to an amphitheater for concerts. The pond for water plants in the right corner of the park is no longer there, and the place is now occupied by children’s play area. The glasshouse that was to the right of the entrance on Eldon Street in 1920 was removed, and the place is currently for water feature.</p><p>Despite the amount of changes in the park, there is still one part of the park that remains unchanged, that is the rose garden just opposite the stage for musicians or today’s theatre. The seats that scattered on the sides of the park have been moved to surround the rose garden in the center. Today’s park also has a new feature which is an underground car park, the entrance to which is just beside the water feature.</p><h1 id="C17-Test1"><a href="#C17-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C17 Test1"></a>C17 Test1</h1><p>The maps below show an industrial area in the town of Norbiton, and planned future development of the site.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The maps compare the current plan of an industrial area in Norbiton with its proposed layout after redevelopment.</p><p>Overall, it can be seen that the traffic system of this area will be extended northward and westward with more extensions added to the existing system. It is also noticeable that residential buildings with relative facilities will replace factories to satisfy citizens’ needs.</p><p>To start with, a number of factories are located in the center of Norbiton, while after revamp, they are expected to make way for facilities including housing, playground, school, shops and medical center, which will be connected via an advanced road system.</p><p>Further, a farmland can currently be found on the north side of a river that is situated in the north of the industrial area. However, the traffic system will extend northward across the river, thus letting the farmland to reducing its size to allow more space for residential constructions.</p><h1 id="OG-T7P1"><a href="#OG-T7P1" class="headerlink" title="OG T7P1"></a>OG T7P1</h1><p>The maps below show the village of Stokeford in 1930 and in 2010.</p><p>7</p><p>In 1930, the River Stoke crossed through the Stokeford from northeast corner to southwest corner and a bridge in the top was over this river for providing the path for the road in this map. It is obvious that there is nothing in the west side of the river. Moving to the east side of the river stoke, the primary school was right in the center of the maps well as next to the farmland. To the south side of the primary school was the gardens with a large house.Besides,along the road from north to south, several buildings, shops, post office and farmland were located in the west side of it.</p><p>After 70 years, as can be seen from the map of 2010, there was no change happened in the west side of the river and about the post office, but all of the farmlands and shops had been demolished.Moreover, the primary school had been expanded with two buildings and to the south of which, the original gardens had been reduced and developed as the retirement home.<br>Lastly, several branches of the road had been constructed with plenty of houses, which had been established along branches.</p><h1 id="OG-T3P1"><a href="#OG-T3P1" class="headerlink" title="OG T3P1"></a>OG T3P1</h1><p>The diagrams below show the changes that have taken place at West Park Secondary School since its construction in 1950.</p><p>7</p><p>The diagrams show west Park School at three different stages in its development: 1950, 1980 and 2010.</p><p>In 1950, the school was built close to a main road and next to a number of houses. A large area behind the school was turned into a playground, while the area behind the houses was farmland. By 1980, the houses had been demolished in order to make way for a small car park and an additional school building, which became the science block. In addition to the existing playground, the school also gained the farmland and converted it into a sports field.</p><p>In 2010, the school building remained unchanged but the car park was extended to cover the entire sports field. As a result of this, the original playground was divided into two so that it provided a smaller playground and a small sports field.</p><p>During this period, the school has increased in size and a car park has been created and enlarged. The combined recreational areas, however, first expanded and were then reduced in size.</p></div><div class="article-licensing box"><div class="licensing-title"><p>Task 1 地图</p><p><a href="https://zoctan.github.io/2022/10/28/zh/english/ielts/writing/task_1/map/">https://zoctan.github.io/2022/10/28/zh/english/ielts/writing/task_1/map/</a></p></div><div class="licensing-meta level is-mobile"><div class="level-left"><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Author</h6><p>Zoctan</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Posted on</h6><p>2022-10-28</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Updated on</h6><p>2022-11-20</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Licensed under</h6><p><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Creative Commons" href="https://creativecommons.org/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons"></i></a><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Attribution 4.0 International" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons-by"></i></a><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Noncommercial" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons-nc"></i></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="addthis_inline_share_toolbox"></div><script src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-634fc88092b0a58a" defer></script></article></div><div class="card"><div class="card-content"><h3 class="menu-label has-text-centered">Like this article?
