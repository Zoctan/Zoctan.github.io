It is also noticeable that the figure for Japan will witness the sharpest increase.</p><p>In the year of 1940, the Japan possessed the lowest proportion of the population aged 65 or over, representing merely 5%. Nevertheless, this figure is expected to climb to 10% in 2030 despite some fluctuation and it will increase more rapidly in the following 10 years to approximately 27% by 2040, being the highest among the three nations.</p><p>When it comes to the rate of Sweden and the USA, the figure for the USA was slightly higher than that of Sweden in 1940, respectively standing at around 9% and 7.5%. Subsequently, the proportion of the two nations grew at distinctive speed and in 1995, the rate of Sweden surpassed the USA.

It is also noticeable that fish was the least popular among the four categories during the period. While in 1979, the average weekly consumption of beef was the highest, the figure for chicken ranked the first in 2004.</p><p>The consumption of chicken showed an upward trend. In the year of 1979, it represented merely 140 grams per person per week, while after 25 years, it soared to 240 grams, although there existed certain fluctuation in this period.</p><p>Similar patterns could be found for the consumption for beef and lamb, initially the rate of beef lied in 220 grams per person per week, approximately 70 grams higher than its counterpart. After some fluctuation, they separately dropped to 120 and 70 grams in 2004. By contrast, the figure for fish was relatively stable. In the year of 1979, a citizen in this country consumed around 70 grams of fish per week, and this rate declined slowly by 20 grams in the 25 years.</p><h1 id="C8-Test4"><a href="#C8-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C8 Test4"></a>C8 Test4</h1><p>The graph below shows the quantities of goods transported in the UK between 1974 and 2002 by four different modes of transport. </p><p>7</p><p>The line graph sheds light on the amount of freight delivered in Britain via four distinctive transporting methods from 1974 to 2002.</p><p>Overall, it can be seen that road remained the dominant transporting mode in the 28 years. It is also noticeable that all modes of transport except rail showed an increase in the amount of goods ferried during the given period.</p><p>In the year of 1974, the volume of good transported by road was the highest (approximately 70 million tones) and it climbed to around 95 million tones after 28 years despite short fluctuations in 1978 and 1992. By contrast, pipeline was regarded as the least popular transporting mode but it showed a steady increase in the freight amount, from 5 million tones in 1974 to four times the value in 2002.</p><p>When it comes to the weight of goods transported by water and rail, their figures were similar in 1974, namely 40 million tones. Nevertheless, the quantities of goods by water rised by 23 million tones in the 28 years, whereas little modification could be found in the volume for railway after a series of fluctuations.</p><h1 id="C9-Test4"><a href="#C9-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C9 Test4"></a>C9 Test4</h1><p>The graph below gives information from a 2008 report about consumption of energy in the USA since 1980 with projections until 2030.</p><p>7</p><p>The given graph illustrates America’s energy consumption from 1980 to 2008 which was the time when the report was written, as well as predictions until 2030. Consumption is divided into six types of fuels, which are petrol and oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, solar or wind, and hydropower. Units are measured in quadrillion units.</p><p>Overall, the use of fossil fuels is predicted to rise considerably and dominate the US energy consumption in 2030, whereas alternative clean energy sources are expected to remain insignificant.</p><p>The consumption of petrol and oil started off at 35 quadrillion units, fluctuated a little during 1980 and 1995 and then steadily increased afterwards. It is predicted to continue rising till 2030 until it almost reached 50 quadrillion units. The consumption of coal started off at a little over 15 quadrillion units. According to the report, its increase slowed down since 1995 and stagnated for about ten years but it is predicted to rise again after 2008. The consumption of natural gas fluctuated a lot during 1980 and 2010 but it was generally increasing. It is predicted to reach a plateau at around 25 quadrillion units after 2015.</p><p>The consumption of three other types of fuel is much lower. All of them started off at lower than five quadrillion units. They all increased during the time period but only by a very small amount and are predicted to stay relatively unchanged after 2008, except for nuclear and solar or wind energy which will see a slight increase before 2030.</p><h1 id="C11-Test3"><a href="#C11-Test3" class="headerlink" title="C11 Test3"></a>C11 Test3</h1><p>The graph below shows average carbon dioxide(CO2) emissions per person in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy and Portugal between 1967 and 2007.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The line graph compares four countries, namely the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy and Portugal with regard to their CO2 release per person from 1967 to 2007.</p><p>Overall, it can be seen that the British greenhouse emission was significantly higher than other nations in the 40 years, and Portugal’s figure was the lowest all the time. It is also noticeable that the figure for Italy and Portugal witnessed an increase, while the rate for the UK and Sweden dropped. In 2007, Sweden’s average carbon emissons equaled Portugal’s.</p><p>When it comes to Britain and Sweden, in 1967, their CO2 emission per individuas lied respectively in 11 and 9 metric tonnes. Although the figure for Sweden climbed to approximately 10.2 metric tonnes 10 years later, the greenhouse release for its counterpart decreased by 0.5 metric tonnes. Subsequently by 2007, the rate of Britain and Sweden fell separately by 1.5 and 4.7 metric tonnes.</p><p>In terms of Italy and Portugal, their CO2 release per person represented respectively in 4.2 and 1.2 metric tonnes in the year of 1967. In the following 40 years, this two figures increased continuously and reached separately 7.6 and 5.5 metric tonnes in 2007.</p><h1 id="C15-Test2"><a href="#C15-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C15 Test2"></a>C15 Test2</h1><p>The graph below shows the number of tourists visiting a particular Caribbean island between 2010 and 2017.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The line graph sheds light on the volume of visitors travelling to a selected Caribbean island from 2010 to 2017.</p><p>Overall, it can be seen that there were more and more travelers coming to the island during the 7 years. It is also noticeable that the volume of tourists staying on cruise ships surpassed the number of visitors staying on island in the selected period.</p><p>In 2010, there were 1 Million sightseers visiting the Caribbean island and in following years this number rose continuously to 3.5 Million in 2017 despite a short stagnant time in 2015.</p><p>In 2010, the volume of visitors staying on island was approximately 0.75 Million, 0.5 Million more than the number of those staying on cruise ships, after which both groups witnessed an increase although certain fluctuation could be found. In 2015, the number of visitors staying on cruise ships exceeded its counterparts and in 2017, the volume of sightseers on cruise ships and island lied respectively in 2 and 1.5 Million.</p><h1 id="C16-Test1"><a href="#C16-Test1" class="headerlink" title="C16 Test1"></a>C16 Test1</h1><p>The charts below show the changes in ownership of electrical appliances and amount of time spent doing housework in households in one country between 1920 and 2019.</p><p>6.5</p><p>From 1920 to 2019, we can see an overall positive trend in percentage of households with electric appliances and an overall negative trend in the number of hours spent doing house work.<br>According to the statistics, the percentage of households owning refrigerators and vacuum cleaners increased more rapidly, from 0% and 30% to both 100% respectively. The percentage of washing machine ownership also increased, however not as much, only found in around 75% of the households in 2019.</p><p>With the increasing amount of household appliances, in the same period we see a steady drop of hours spent doing housework per week. By 1920 the number amounted to 50 hours per week but by 2019 the number dropped down to around 10 hours per week. We also see that both the washing machine and fridge percentage rose most steeply around the period of 1920s to 1980s, which correlates to a period of relatively steeper decrease in hours spent on house work.</p><p>In conclusion, between 1920s to 2019 the percentage of all appliance ownership increased, and almost every household in this country by 2019 has a Vacuum cleaner or a Refrigerator. The number of hours spent on housework decreased in this same period, from 50 hours down to only 10 hours, which correlates with the more common ownership of electric appliances that can speed up the process.</p><h1 id="C17-Test4"><a href="#C17-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C17 Test4"></a>C17 Test4</h1><p>The graph below shows the number of shops that closed and the number of new shops that opened in one country between 2011 and 2018.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The given graph gives information about the number of shops that closed and the number of shops that opened in one country from the year 2011 to 2018.</p><p>Overall, the number of shop closures and openings both witnessed a downward trend. The number of shops closed was generally greater than the number of shops opened.</p><p>The number of shop closures dropped from around 6,500 in 2011 to a little over 5,000 in 2018. The number of shops closed decreased a little from 2011 to 2012 and rose to over 7,000 in 2013. It then declined a little again in 2014. After that, the number of shops closed plummeted to below 1,000 in 2015 and it rose again to a little over 5,000 in 2016. The number fluctuated slightly in the remaining two years of the period.</p><p>The number of shop openings dropped from about 8,500 in 2011 to 3,000 in 2018. The number of shops opened decreased dramatically from 2011 to 2012, then rose again in the next two years to a little over 6,000. It then reduced again to about 4000 in the year of 2015. The number remained unchanged in 2016 and it increased a little bit in 2017 and then declined to 3,000 in 2018.</p><h1 id="OG-T6P1"><a href="#OG-T6P1" class="headerlink" title="OG T6P1"></a>OG T6P1</h1><p>The chart below shows the changes that took place in three different areas of crime in Newport city centre from 2003-2012.</p><p>7</p><p>This graph illustrates how crime rates altered in Newport inner city during the period 2003-2012. We can see immediately that the greatest change occurred in the number of burglaries,while incidents of theft remained low but steady.</p><p>In 2003, we can see that burglary was the most common crime,with approximately 3,400 reported cases. The figure rose to around 3,700 in 2004, but then there was a downward trend until 2008.At this point the figure stood at just over 1,000 incidents.This rose slightly in 2009, then continued to fluctuate for the remaining period.</p><p>In 2003, the number of cars being stolen stood at around2.800 and followed a similar trend to burglary until 2006.At this point the number rose, standing at around 2,200 in 2007.There was a marginal decrease in the following year,but from then on, the trend was generally upwards.<br>Finally, robbery has always been a fairly minor problem for Newport. The number of offences committed changed little over nine years.
