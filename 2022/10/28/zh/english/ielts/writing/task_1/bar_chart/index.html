Employer support is measured by time off and help with fees.</p><p>Overall, the younger the students are, the more likely they are studying for career. By contrast, the older they get, the more likely they are studying for interest. Employer’s support is the highest with students under the age of 26, and lowest with students aged between 30 to 39.</p><p>80% of those aged under 26 are studying for career. This percentage decreases as the age of students goes up. There are less than 20% of the students aged over 49 studying for career. This trend is reversed when it comes to students who study for interest. There are only 10% of students aged under 26 studying for interest. The percentage rises as the student age. Among those aged over 49, 70% of them study for interest. There are as many students who study for career as students who study for interest among the age group 40 to 49, with a percentage at a little above 40%.</p><p>Students under 26 get the highest level of employer support. Level of support decreases as students age. Students aged between 30 to 39 only get half the amount of support of those received by students under 26. However, the amount of support slowly rises when students’ age goes beyond 40 years old. Students aged between 40 to 49 get more support than those aged between 30 to 39, and those aged over 49 get even more, but the amount never exceeds that received by those under 26.</p><h1 id="C6-Test4"><a href="#C6-Test4" class="headerlink" title="C6 Test4"></a>C6 Test4</h1><p>The charts below give information about USA marriage and divorce rates between 1970 and 2000, and the marital status of adult Americans in two of the years.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The given charts illustrate America’s marriage and divorce rates from 1970 to 2000, as well as the marital status of adult Americans in 1970 and 2000.</p><p>Overall, number of marriages decreased over the time period given, while number of divorces increased in 1980 and decreased to its original amount by 2000. In both 1970 and 2000, most American adults were married but there were slightly more marriages in 1970 than in 2000. The group who never married ranked the second, followed by the widowed population and then the divorced population.</p><p>There were 2.5 million marriages in America in both 1970 and 1980, then the number decreased to 2 million in 2000. There were 1 million divorces in America in 1970, and then the number rose to something close to 1.5 million in 1980. However, the number of divorce dropped in the following years and by 2000 there were 1 million divorces, same as 1970.</p><p>In 1970, married Americans took up 70% of the population. Those who never married were about 15% of the population. The widowed population accounted for less than 10% of the population and the divorced population was even less. In 2000, the married population’s percentage dropped to a little less than 60%. The second highest percentage was still the group who never married, but its percentage increased to 20%.

The electricity production in France in 1980 was roughly evenly distributed among four fuel types with hydro power being the only type that had a much smaller proportion.</p><p>In Australia, the percentage taken up by coal increased a lot in 2000 where coal took up around 75% of all electricity production. Electricity produced by hydro power increased a little from 20 units in 1980 to 36 units in 2000. The percentage of natural gas and oil reduced dramatically to only 2 units.</p><p>In France, coal, oil, and natural gas were the three main fuel sources in 1980. The smallest proportion was found in hydro power in 1980. In 2000, the proportions of natural gas and hydro power both shrank to 2 units. The percentage of coal and oil remain roughly the same at 25 units, while nuclear power increased dramatically to take up almost 75% of all electricity produced.</p><h1 id="C9-Test2"><a href="#C9-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C9 Test2"></a>C9 Test2</h1><p>The chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in the UK, divided into three categories, from 1995—2002.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The chart gives information about the total time spend in billions of minutes on three different types of phone calls in the UK from 1995 to 2002.

The highest difference in percentage occurred in the age group 35 to 44 - there were 13% more physically active people in the female population than in the male population, whilst there was only a minimal difference between men and women aged 65 and above. In the age group 35 to 44, there are 52.5% female population that did physical activity regularly but only 39.5% men who did the same. In the age group 65 and above, there are 46.7% men and 47.1% women who did physical activity regularly.

Frequencies are described in six levels, which are every day, sacral times a week, once a week, once or twice a month, a few times a year and never.</p><p>Overall, most people in the US went to fast food restaurants once a week or once or twice a month. The second highest percentage was seen in the group who went to fast food restaurant several times a week and the third highest was seen in the group who went to fast food restaurant a few times a year. People who had fast food every day had the least percentage, and people who never went to fast food restaurant ranked the second lowest among all groups. The layout of percentages was almost the same across the three recorded years but there were also some differences. For example, in 2003 and 2006, over 30% of the population frequented fast food restaurants once a week, but in 2013, this frequency held less percentage. In 2013, the highest percentage, also a little over 30%, was seen in the group who visited fast food restaurants once or twice a month.</p><p>The group who went to fast food restaurants several times a week had a percentage that ranged from 15% to 20% over the given time period, with the highest percentage being in 2006. The group who went to fast food restaurants a few times a year had a slightly less percentage that ranged from around 13% to 15%. Both the groups that went to fast food restaurants every day and the group that never went to fast food restaurants had percentages less than 5%, except for the people in 2003 who never went to fast food restaurants which reached a percentage of 5%.</p><h1 id="C13-Test2"><a href="#C13-Test2" class="headerlink" title="C13 Test2"></a>C13 Test2</h1><p>The chart below shows the percentage of households in owned and rented accommodation in England and Wales between 1918 and 2011.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The given chart shows the percentage of owned and rented households in England and Wales from the year 1918 to 2011.</p><p>Overall, there were significantly more rented accommodation than owned ones in England and Wales before 1971, and the trend reversed after 1971. In the year of 1971, the percentage of owned households equaled that of rented households.</p><p>Before 1971, the percentage of owned households were steadily increasing from a little above 20% in the year of 1918 to over 40% in the year of 1961. By contrast, the percentage of rented households steadily decreased from 1918 to 1961, thereby reducing the gap between the percentage of owned and rented accommodation. At first, the percentage of rented households was about triple that of the owned ones, reaching near 80% while owned households were at a little over 20%. By 1961, the percentage of rented households were a little less than 60%, while that of owned households reached 40%.</p><p>After 1971, the percentage of owned households increased slightly until 2011 when it saw a small decrease again. The trend for rented households was the exact opposite. The percentage of rented households started to decrease since 1981 and only in 2011 saw a slight increase.

The level of donations from the 26-35 age-group also experienced a decrease in 2010 from 31% to 24%.</p><p>While donations up to the age of 50 declined across the two years, they rose among the 51-65 age-group from 35% to nearly 40%, which was the highest percentage for 2010.The figure for the over 65s was lower than this, at 35%, but it was still a little higher than the 1990 figure of 32%.</p><h1 id="OG-T4P1"><a href="#OG-T4P1" class="headerlink" title="OG T4P1"></a>OG T4P1</h1><p>The chart below gives information about Southland’s main exports in 2000, *20.., and future projections for 2025.</p><p>7</p><p>This bar chart illustrates the performance of Southland’s primary exports in 2000 and 2013.It also indicates future projections for 2025.According to the data, it seems likely that international tourism will become the dominant industry,although dairy exports will remain strong. In 2000, we can see that tourism was the greatest exports earner of the three industries, with revenue standing at just over £8 billion.This figure has increased slightly, so that now, in 2013, it has reached almost £9 billion. It is estimated that international tourism will continue to grow, so that by 2025, it will be earning around £l0 billion for the country. In 2000, dairy exports were worth around £7 billion, but since then there has been a dramatic increase, and sales for this year are approximately £10 billion. Experts are predicting that exports in this area may fall slightly, so a figure of £9.5 billion is expected for 2025. Meat products are the third key industry in Southland, but sales have dropped since 2000 and now stand at £5.5 billion.It is expected that sales will continue to decrease in the future.</p><h1 id="OG-T8P1"><a href="#OG-T8P1" class="headerlink" title="OG T8P1"></a>OG T8P1</h1><p>The chart below shows the annual number of rentals and sales (in various formats) of films from a particular store between 2002 and 2011.</p><p>7</p><p>The number of rentals and sales in various formats of films,between 2002 and 2011 in a particular store has changed a lot. Sometimes it has been very low and sometimes very high.The number of rental since 2002.has been decreasing every year.Comparing the number of rentals in 2002 with 2011,it ‘s possible noticing that in 2002 it was about 180,000 rentals against approximately 55,000 in 2011. In regarding the number of VHS sales, comparing the period between 2002 and 2005,it has happened as well. In 2002 the number of VHS sales was about 85,000 sales, against 65,000 in 2003,40,000 in 2004 and about 10.000 sales in 2005.After that time, this store stopped to sale VHS.By another side, the number of DVD sales grew up between 2002 and 2007, from approximately 45,000 in 2002,more than 100,000 in 2003, to more than 200,000 in 2007.However,since 2008, it has been going down slightly.In 2011this number was less than 180,000.</p><p>The number of Blu-Ray sales has started since 2007 and it has growing up slowly. In 2007 it was nowhere near as significant as DVD sales but I guess it will grow up drastically in a few years. Actually the number of DVD sales is still very higher than another products in that place.</p></div><div class="article-licensing box"><div class="licensing-title"><p>Task 1 条形图</p><p><a href="https://zoctan.github.io/2022/10/28/zh/english/ielts/writing/task_1/bar_chart/">https://zoctan.github.io/2022/10/28/zh/english/ielts/writing/task_1/bar_chart/</a></p></div><div class="licensing-meta level is-mobile"><div class="level-left"><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Author</h6><p>Zoctan</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Posted on</h6><p>2022-10-28</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Updated on</h6><p>2022-11-20</p></div></div><div class="level-item is-narrow"><div><h6>Licensed under</h6><p><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Creative Commons" href="https://creativecommons.org/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons"></i></a><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Attribution 4.0 International" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons-by"></i></a><a class="icons" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Noncommercial" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><i class="icon fab fa-creative-commons-nc"></i></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="addthis_inline_share_toolbox"></div><script src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-634fc88092b0a58a" defer></script></article></div><div class="card"><div class="card-content"><h3 class="menu-label has-text-centered">Like this article?
